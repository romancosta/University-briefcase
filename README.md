This repository is currently evolving and is intended to carry and reflect my interest in analytics.

I am a senior at Elon University pursuing a B.S.B.A. degree in Business Management with a concentration in Business Analytics.

Working to build a foundation for growth in an analytics-based career that will see me add value to organizations by leveraging data to uncover actionable insights.
